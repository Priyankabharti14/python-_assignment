       "\"Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error?\\nProvide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\\n\\nThe margin of error (MOE) in a confidence interval (CI) represents the amount of error or uncertainty associated\\nwith estimating a population parameter (such as the population mean) based on a sample statistic (such as the \\nsample mean). It indicates the maximum likely difference between the sample statistic and the true population \\nparameter. The smaller the margin of error, the more precise the estimate.\\n\\nThe formula to calculate the margin of error depends on several factors, including the confidence level, the \\nstandard deviation of the population (or the sample), and the sample size. Generally, the margin of error is \\ncalculated as:\\n    Margin of Error (MOE)=Critical Value× Standard Deviation/root of (sample size)\\nHow sample size affects the margin of error:\\n1.Inverse Relationship: The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. This \\nmeans that as the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, and vice versa.\\n2.Larger Sample Size, Smaller Margin of Error: With a larger sample size, the sample mean becomes a more accurate \\nestimate of the population mean, and the variability of the sample mean decreases.
