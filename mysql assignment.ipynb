Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\\n\\nIn SQL, when you construct a query with multiple clauses, the order of execution is typically as follows:\\n\\n1. **FROM**: The `FROM` clause is the first to be processed. It specifies the tables from which the data will be\\nretrieved. If your query involves multiple tables (e.g., in a JOIN operation), the tables are joined at this \\nstage.\\n\\n2. **WHERE**: The `WHERE` clause comes after the `FROM` clause. It is used to filter rows based on specified \\nconditions. Rows that do not meet the criteria defined in the `WHERE` clause are excluded from the result set.\\n\\n3. **GROUP BY**: If you are using the `GROUP BY` clause, it is processed next. This clause groups rows with\\nsimilar values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate \\nfunctions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc., to perform calculations on grouped data.\\n\\n4. **HAVING**: The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause. It filters the result\\nset based on conditions applied to the grouped data. Rows that do not satisfy the `HAVING` conditions are \\nexcluded from the result.\\n\\n5. **SELECT**: The `SELECT` clause comes after the previous clauses. It specifies the columns that should be\\nincluded in the result set. Any calculations, aliases, or expressions in the `SELECT` clause are also \\nevaluated at this stage.\\n\\n6. **DISTINCT**: If you are using the `DISTINCT` keyword, duplicate rows are removed from the result set at\\nthis point.\\n\\n7. **ORDER BY**: The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns and their sort\\norder (ascending or descending). It is typically one of the last clauses to be executed.\\n\\n8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: If you are using the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses, they are applied after sorting. \\n`LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned, while `OFFSET` specifies the starting point for the result set.\\n\\n9. **UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT**: If you are using set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT`, they\\nare applied after all the previous clauses. These operations combine or compare the result sets of multiple\\nqueries.\\n\\n10. **Joins**: If your query involves multiple tables and you're not using explicit `JOIN` clauses (i.e., you're\\nusing implicit joins), the database engine determines the join order and executes the joins accordingly.\""

    "conditions. Rows that do not meet the criteria defined in the `WHERE` clause are excluded from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY**: If you are using the `GROUP BY` clause, it is processed next. This clause groups rows with\n",
    "similar values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate \n",
    "functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc., to perform calculations on grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING**: The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause. It filters the result\n",
    "set based on conditions applied to the grouped data. Rows that do not satisfy the `HAVING` conditions are \n",
    "excluded from the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT**: The `SELECT` clause comes after the previous clauses. It specifies the columns that should be\n",
    "included in the result set. Any calculations, aliases, or expressions in the `SELECT` clause are also \n",
    "evaluated at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DISTINCT**: If you are using the `DISTINCT` keyword, duplicate rows are removed from the result set at\n",
    "this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns and their sort\n",
    "order (ascending or descending). It is typically one of the last clauses to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: If you are using the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses, they are applied after sorting. \n",
    "`LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned, while `OFFSET` specifies the starting point for the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT**: If you are using set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT`, they\n",
    "are applied after all the previous clauses. These operations combine or compare the result sets of multiple\n",
    "queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Joins**: If your query involves multiple tables and you're not using explicit `JOIN` clauses (i.e., you're\n",
    "using implicit joins), the database engine determines the join order and executes the joins accordingly.'''\n",
